There are also other specialized and advanced degrees, but you need your bachelor degree before everything. If you want to be a primary teacher, then you'll need a degree of Bachelor of Education (BEd.) But, if you want to be a secondary teacher, you have to do your bachelor in your preferred subject. Your major in your degree will determine which subject you'll be teaching. Earning a bachelor degree will require 3 to 4 years. However, if you want to be a nursery or pre-school teacher, you don't need a bachelor degree rather a proper license and certification in teaching children."
